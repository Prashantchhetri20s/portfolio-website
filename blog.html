                            <p>Artificial Intelligence is a brain-like computer capable of thought, interpreting, and making self-decisions. To put it another way, AI is the neural science, mathematic and computer science having computer that can communciate in a nautural language, able to think, reasoning, analyzing and identifying the past data and can make a better self-decision through the experince itself. It holds a tendency to cause a machine to work like human. To know about the AI, it needs to know about basic AI concept that are deep learning, machine learning and neural networks. And the measure objective and purpose of AI is to enable computers to perform such intellectual tasks as decision making, problem solving, perception, understanding human communication.</p>

                            <p>In the mordern world, AI is used everywhere. It is currently used with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific like auto driving car, playing chess, proving thorem, playing music and many others. It is one of the fascinating and universal field of computer science that have the great scope of future. AI is categorized into following types on the basis of it performance, capability and ability. They are:-</p>

                                <li><b>Reduction of Human Error</b>: As it will be able to think, analyse and identify the data itself and make a decision itself with its accurate measurement.</li>
                               <br>
                                <li><b>Digital assistance:</b> It will be as a digital assistance that perform the human task as a human but in a digital way. That will perform all the task through its digital calculation and measurement to solve every problem in every field.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Faster decision:</b> It would be able to take a decision faster than human being. It have the capacity to analyse the past data like image, text, conversation and situation based machine that can identify the patterns of the data and process them faster to make a better decision and make a faster decision.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Improves security:</b> AI is the machine with the super intelligence that have very low chance of getting fault with its system.</li>

                                <li><b>High cost of Implementation:-</b> It required high cost to build the AI based machine or computer  because  entails huge costs given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one. Further, the astronomical expense doesn’t stop there as repair and maintenance also run into thousands of dollars. </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><b>Risk of Unemployment:</b> It is mention above that AI will be taking place as a digital assistance. It may create risk for employment. If multi-task would be perform by single AI machine then it’s require less employment for an organization.  </li> <!--listing-->

                            <p>AI in the today's world, it is being used everywhere. And the many technologies use the AI technologies to beat the need to perform their task accurately, efectively and faster. This technology is widely used allover the world. A few examples include Siri, Cortana, and Alexa, which are gaining popularity because of the user experience they provide. Amazon's Echo is an example of how artificial intelligence can be used to translate human language into desirable actions. </p>
